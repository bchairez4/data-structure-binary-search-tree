# data-structure-binary-search-tree

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the Binary Search Tree data structure using dynamic nodes utilizing raw pointers.
This implementation of the Binary Search Tree is unbalanced, meaning it does not self-balance, and does not allow duplicate inserts.
Binary Search Trees follow a strict weak ordering meaning an internal node's value will be greater than the values of it's left subtree yet less than the values of it's right subtree.
Memory management handled internally using "new" and "delete".
