# data-structure-binary-search-tree

Created by Brian Chairez

This C++ project implements the Binary Search Tree data structure using dynamic nodes utilizing raw pointers.
This implementation of the Binary Search Tree is unbalanced, meaning it does not self-balance, and does not allow duplicate inserts.
Memory management handled internally using "new" and "delete".

Basic functionality complete.
